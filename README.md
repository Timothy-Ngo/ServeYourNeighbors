## About 
This is a senior level capstone computer science project at the University of Nevada, Reno.

Serve Your Neighbors is a 2D, casual, arcade-style game where you play as an up-and-coming restaurateur in a world of foodies. Unlike other restaurant management video games, Serve Your Neighbors has unique kidnapping and distraction mechanics that allow players to balance the ability to serve yummier meals with their reputation. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the game that keeps players hooked and creates a more strategic environment for players to consider. These new systems are important because innovation is vital to keep video games exciting. Our team has created a playable demo version with a complete game loop: loss conditions, kidnapping and distraction mechanics, cooking systems, customer pathfinding and behavior systems, and a currency and upgrade system. We have also prepared draft marketing materials in preparation for our release on itch.io and Steam. (12/7/23)
